    "## **Diamond Price Prediction Projects**\n",
    "### **Business Understanding**\n",
    "Diamonds are among the most valuable natural substances, primarily composed of carbon. Unlike gold or silver, pricing diamonds is more complex due to various features influencing their value, such as structure, cut, carat, clarity, and inclusions (impurities).\n",
    "\n",
    "The pricing system for diamonds is standardized globally through the \"four Cs\" â€” Cut, Color, Clarity, and Carat, which allows uniform understanding and ease of trade. These metrics determine the quality and price of diamonds.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Understanding the 4 C's**\n",
    "- **Cut:** Refers to how well a diamond is cut, impacting its brilliance.\n",
    "- **Color:** A measure of how colorless a diamond is (ranging from D, which is colorless, to J, - which is light yellow).\n",
    "- **Clarity:** Refers to the internal purity of the diamond (graded from I1, which is the worst, to IF, which is flawless).\n",
    "- **Carat:** The weight of the diamond.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Problem Statement**\n",
    "We aim to build a system that can predict the price of a diamond based on features such as carat, cut, color, clarity, and its dimensions (x, y, z). This project will walk through steps like data preprocessing, model building, and prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Agenda**\n",
    "In this notebook, we will perform:\n",
    "- Step:1) Import Necessary Libraries and Load the Datasets\n",
    "- Step:2) Preform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n",
    "- Step:3) Split the Data into Train and Test Data\n",
    "- Step:4) Data Preparations: Data Cleaning and Feature Transformations (in both Train and Test Data)\n",
    "- Step:5) Training Phase: Building a Models\n",
    "- Step:6) Model Evaluation and Predictions"
